# Building-a-NASM-and-C-based-32-Bit-Protected-Mode-Kernel-for-Tetris
A 32-bit protected-mode kernel built with NASM and C that runs Tetris. The NASM bootloader loads the C kernel, which handles game logic, graphics, and input. This project demonstrates the power of low-level programming and serves as a learning tool for bare-metal game and system development.
